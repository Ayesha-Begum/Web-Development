<h1>MOTHER'S ETERNAL LOVE</h1>

<p>Miles and miles away from you is existing your girl, the little one you raised made her way with your 

love and faith. My life embarked with your torment. The so called parturition is just like a 

resurrection but you call it a sweet and precious suffering. And a life came into an existence.

Mother, unlike others your love is pristine and immaculate. My oodles of mistakes and umpteen 

squabbles with you, nothing lasted forever but your love only lingered. Sometimes I acted innocent 

just only for your contemplation. Though you know that my innocence is an act of dragging your 

attention, you at ones came to me ignoring your hectic chores. Apart from your heavy work, you 

remained vigour only to make me smile. You camouflaged my asinine faults before people but 

contemporarily made me aware of the mistake.</p>

<p>Your dictionary is aware of only one word Lark but not siesta. The sacrifices you made, the pain you 

suffered, the tears you she, the love you gave and the things you shared throughout my life is 

unrequitable.</p>

<p>The day when I parted from you, your eyes were moist with tears. And that petty thing in your eyes I 

found was only love. The Eternal Love of a mother. Everyone says that a child is Motherâ€™s Insignia. 

But, I say your Love is my Insignia. Today I am here with your simulations, of love and trust and faith 

and hope. Things you taught me were treasured carefully in my heart.</p>

<p>No one can reciprocate your love. Your love for me is unreturned. Thank you for this life and thank 

you for everything you have done to me.</p>

<p>Love you "AMMI" Love you forever.</p>
