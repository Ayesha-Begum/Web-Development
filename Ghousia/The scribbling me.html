<div class="started">
<h3>It all started:</h3>
<p>When I was in class 8
 inspired by my sister
 who gave me motivation to 
write by doing all the crazy stuff and irritating me always.</p>


<p>At the age of 23 my first e-book 'I thought you were mine' was published
It gave me lot of strength and positiveness in proceeding further. 
Day by day I improvised and started writing in the local language Telugu. 
Many short stories like Ram-Sita, Pooja, Bandhutvam were sent for publications 
but were never published. I felt bad. But never gave up.
 The reason behind me never giving up is my supporting family.</p>

<p>I write shahiries too.
Participated in a contest named Raindrops on paper conducted by writersmelon blog. 
And my article with title Father's princess got selected and was published in TOI.<p>

<p>Find below some of my scribblings. Hope you like it :)</p>
