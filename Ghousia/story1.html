<h1>RAIN CLEARED MY PAIN</h1>

<p>Outside it is raining incessantly and inside a coffee day I am enjoying a hot coffee with my love 

Arnav. He is thinking deeply. Suddenly “Sonia lets breakup” he said. I smiled “Stop joking now 

Arnav”. “No, I am serious. I can't handle this relationship anymore he said with a firm tone. This 

time my hand shivered. I placed coffee cup on the table and pressed his hand and said “What 

happened Arnav? You love me right and we were in this relation for last 3 years and there was never 

a cramp in our relation, then...” my voice quivered. “It was just a...” he paused and again said “Sonia 

please understand me”. He got up but I didn’t leave his hand. I stood up “Arnav please don’t leave 

me”. “I am sorry Sonia I have to leave you” he said simply and left. </p>

<p>From that day I was completely 

obsessed with his thoughts and memories we spent together. Days passed by not even a single call 

from him. My hundreds of messages and calls were left unanswered. A week passed and I was still in 

my room thinking of him. Suddenly my phone beeped. Expecting that beep must be his message I 

opened the text. And it was from my friend Shraddha. The text was ‘He bilked you but he is happy. 

There is no regret in him. He is enjoying with his friends and a girl on his bike. It’s over Sonia leave 

your past and live your life’ text ended. I was uncontrollable and cried incessantly till my heart said 

“enough I can’t tolerate this pressure anymore”. My eyes said “enough I can’t pour down anymore” 

and my heart said “I know what to do now”. Immediately I got up took a bath and changed into 

white kurta and pink legging, checked my attire and visage. It’s raining outside. I came out and hired 

an auto and directly went to his house. He was standing there with his bike, ready to move out, May 

be with his new girlfriend. On seeing me he became still. I went near him, removed the ring from my 

finger which he gifted me on a Valentine’s Day and placed it in his hand and said “you are unfit for 

me”.</p>

<p>He stood there staring and I left that place with much more confidence and much happier.

I turned my head towards sky. Each and every rain drop falling on my face were soothing me saying 

“what you did is right Sonia”. Now I feel the rain washing away my pain.</p>
