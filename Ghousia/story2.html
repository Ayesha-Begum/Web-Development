<h1>DAMN CUTE AASMA</h1>
<p>On a hot sunny day I came from market holding an overloaded bag in my hand, dropped it in kitchen 

and making huff puff sounds sat on a sofa. "Maa I want lemonade please" I shouted to my mom in 

kitchen. Within seconds lemonade was in my hand. "Thank you maa" I said and relieved from the 

scorching heat fuming from my body. All of a sudden there was a drastic change in environment and 

the cool breeze moved in. Immediately I ran on to the terrace and to my surprise there was a large 

nimbus in the sky ready to reduce its weight by pouring down. I rejoiced by the scene and started 

whirling, moving my dupatta in the direction of wind. Immediately I ran down and shouted "Maa I'm 

going out, will come back soon". Without waiting for her permission I ran out with my Kolhapuri 

chappals which I bought in a carnival near beach. I called my friend Ayesha who is two streets away 

from my place and we went to beach on our bikes.</p>

<p>Outing with a close buddy. That too on a Chilly 

weather. And that too on a bike. And the destination is BEACH. Wow. Quite thrilling. We parked our 

bikes and were strolling on the sands. Ayesha started irking me saying come lets get our legs wet in 

the cool salty water, which I am not at all interested to do. But finally she was succeeded in making 

my mind. We were playing hide and seek with the waves. Suddenly my foody friends' taste buds 

were activated by the Aroma of some yummy food item. "Hey there that man makes yummy papady 

chat come lets enjoy it" she said. We both walked to that place and ordered two papady chats. He 

served it hot and that was really good. My mouth watered before I placed the 1st spoon into my 

mouth. Yummy I smacked my lips. It's worth eating twice but my conscience paused me saying 

"Maintain diet". And finally the large nimbus burst out into huge rain. We both ran to the open 

restaurant where they are serving under an umbrella. "Really romantic place Ayesha, must surely 

come with boyfriend if we really do." We both giggled.</p>

<p>Excuse me our giggle was interpreted by a 

handsome lad. We were seeing him with a question on our face. I think he understood what we 

were thinking, and took a key from his pocket and said "you dropped it when you are parking your 

bike" he said. Then I realised and checked my sling bag and noticed my bike key missing. "Ohh thank 

you so much" I replied. He smiled and left. Ayesha started teasing me. I understood her intension 

and said "shut up he just gave the lost key okay". "Oh really! Then can you explain about your new 

chain hanging with your key" she said. Then I took attention and saw the key which was hooked up 

with a key chain on which it was written "you are damn cute". My cheeks turned Pink. To my 

surprise my name was also written "AASMA".</p>
