<h1>FATHER'S PRINCESS</h1>
<p>Rain rain go away</br>

Come again another day</br>

Mrs. Ghousia want a way</br>

To go to her Father's place</br>

Rain rain go away...</p>

<p>Crooning this rain song I sat near window. It's raining. A zephyr through the window replenished

my memories with Dad and Rain. I commemorate the days when my dad used to drop me to

school on his bicycle and when it rained he used to help me wearing a raincoat. When I was in

class III, I was very disappointed at the fact that my friends were making boats and let them sail in

water when I was sitting there watching them not knowing how to make a paper boat. Then you

empathized and rendered me dad. Finally my paper boat is ready to sail in the streams of rain

water in front of my house. I was jumping and clapping watching my boat moving sternly .You

rescued me against all odds.</p>

<p>Days and years passed by. Your little Princess is someone's queen

now. The day when I moved away from you with my bag and baggage I cried insanely but you

didn't cry dad. Instead you hugged me and said "Dear, nothing to worry. You are always my

princess". And your kiss on my forehead still I feel it. And now your little princess will someday

deliver another cute little Angel. Waiting with ecstasy for that moment when my cute little Angel

comes to know that her mother is still the princess of her Father.</p>

<p>No one can apart us Dad.</p>

<p>As a sign of mercy from Rain God, a sudden gust of wind blew away all the nimbus and the sky

cleared. Finally your princess is ready to go.</p>

<p>Rain rain thank you for making my way...</br>My Dad is waiting for my stay...</p>

<p>Love you Dad.</p>
