<h1>GOAL</h1>
<p>Plan your ideas</p>

<p>Plan your ideas and live your life your way!</p>

<p>To be successfull in life, you need to have a life plan. Without a plan, many of your dreams will

only be dreams. A life plan, on the other hand, will help you turn your dreams into reality. It works

because it gives not just a destination, but also a way to get there.</p>

<p>Plan your Move</p>

<p>A goal without a plan is just a wish!</p>

<p>After knowing your destination and how to get there, you ned to execute your plan. Focus is

essential to execute your plan. Focus is essential for you to achieve your goals. Without focus you

will spread your effort and attention too thin and eventually achieve nothing. Becareful though.

You should be focussed but not obsessed.</p>

<p>Plan your Destination</p>

<p>A dream without destination has no ending!</p>

<p>You should know where you are going. Not knowing your destination is a mistake because you

may end up in the wrong place. You need to know where you want to go so that you dont waste

your time and effort. Planning your destination in the early stages helps you in calculating how far

you have reached in your life.</p>

<p>Plan your Goals</p>

<p>Plan a goal and try staying on the track!</p>

<p>Setting goals is something we do naturally. The trouble is, most of us a tendency to do so almost

unconsciously without taking the time to perfect the process. Then, when things dont turn up the

way we hoped, we internalize our dissappointment in a way that creates doubt in our own abilities.

If this happens, you once believed that you once believed that you had the ability to achieve

success.</p>

<p>Plan your Target</p>

<p>Targets for the stars and may be you will reach the sky!!!</p>

<p>To achieve success in life target setting is very important. But people do not know how to set

targets and how to implement. The ability to set targets and make plans for their achievment is the

tremendous ability of success. It is the single most significant ability that you can learn and

perfect. Until you become determined about your targets, nothing really happens.</p>

<p>Plan your Responsibilities</p>

<p>Big pay and little responsibility are seldom found together!</p>

<p>The most important aspect of the life is of taking resposibility for your life is to acknowledge that

your life is your responsibility. No one can live your life for you. You are in charge. No matter how

hard you try to blame others for the events of your life, each event is the resut of choices you

made and are making. Control your defensive reaction because blames and excuses are the

hallmarks of an unsuccessful life.</p>
